      Entry #34: Plagiarism
    </div>
    <div class="title1">The Concept of Plagiarism By Unknown Writer</div>
    <div class="text1">
      What does it mean if your work is identical to someone else's? Did you
      create the writing and all the ideas were yours? Whichever party you may
      be apart of, you are participating in a case of plagiarism. Writing is the
      opportunity to take all the thoughts in your mind and transfer them into a
      physical embodiment. The Oxford Dictionary defines plagiarism as: “The
      practice of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as
      one's own.” This definition encompasses not only the exact text that was
      written but also minor adjustments such as insertion and truncation of
      sentences or<!--THIS IS A JOKE... ARI KATZ WROTE THIS ESSAY-->
      modifying parts of speech. The reason why those changes qualify as
      plagiarism is because the plagiarizer has not described their own ideas
      entirely in the work. Instead the plagiarizer took the ideas “...passing
      them off as one’s own...” to gain credit for the piece while avoiding to
      put in the work. The problem for the plagiarizer is that they don’t<!--THIS IS A JOKE... ARI KATZ WROTE THIS ESSAY-->
      acquire any new writing skills and they never get to express their true
      ideas. On the other hand, the person who is responsible for the essay<!--THIS IS A JOKE... ARI KATZ WROTE THIS ESSAY-->
      never gets credited for their work and they may be the one that gets
      mistaken for plagiarizing. In the end, plagiarism is a messy situation all
      around and it is better for everyone if you take the initiative to do the
      work honestly.<!--THIS IS A JOKE... ARI KATZ WROTE THIS ESSAY-->
