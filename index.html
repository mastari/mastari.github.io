        <div class="note-preview-text text-hidden-">Physics studies how the universe behaves, not why it exists. The appearance of physics getting closer to the core of existence is an illusion that must be addressed.
It all comes down to ontology. Physics explains holistic behavior in terms of reduced behavior. For example, a moving car can be explained by analyzing the composition of forces within the car system. After analysis, we may wonder why forces occur in the first place - leading us to particle physics and general relativity. Then we question those topics and ask why fields exist or why space curves… The futility of it all is never realized because our minds are wired to always find a last reason. It’s why physics is endless, explanations of existence will only find solace through religious fictions, and no closure will satisfy the broken hearted. The “last reason” is the macguffin of reality.</div>

        <div class="note-preview-text text-hidden-">Unfortunately, that alone is quite meaningless. It’s akin to knowing all the tools in the kitchen but never daring to cook. Moreover, it’s the application of knowing the rules that grants physics its importance. Physics is the basis of chemistry, biology, neurology, and much more. It is quite literally the study that encapsulates everything that moves. Studying physics exclusively has left me feeling like I have all the tools to cook without actually making any food.
Today, I recognize that applying physics is our only fighting chance against some of the most pressing terrors we face today. Currently, global warming and humanitarian crises plague us all; if physics doesn’t optimize how our world is engineered today, our children will pay the mortal toll tomorrow.</div>

        <div class="note-preview-text text-hidden-">Things move relatively. You may be sitting down motionless with respect to Earth’s surface, while also orbiting at 30,000 m/s with respect to the Sun. Relativity is about two kinds of motion.
Intrinsic motion is an object's motion with respect to space itself. It is impossible to truly observe intrinsic motion due to the observer having motion of its own. Apparent motion is the observed motion with respect to another entity. The delineation of these two motions is essential. </div>
