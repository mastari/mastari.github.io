<div style="text-align:center;">
If we know the rules, we consider that we ‘understand’ the world<br/>
- Richard P. Feynman
</div>
<p>As a simple man, I am humbled by the grass, wind, stars, and bugs. I love discovering the rules that connect the many corners of the universe. Lately, I’ve been introspectively questioning <i>why</i>? Unromatically, the immediate explanation is:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
Physics teaches us the rules
</div>
<p>Although, that alone is quite shallow. It’s akin to knowing all the tools in the kitchen but never daring to cook. Moreover, it’s the application of knowing the rules that grants physics its importance. Physics reigns over chemistry, biology, neurology, and much more. It is quite literally the study that encapsulates everything that moves. Studying physics exclusively has left me feeling like I have all the tools to cook without actually making any food. Today, I recognize that applying physics is our only fighting chance against some of the most pressing terrors we face today. Currently, global warming and humanitarian crises plague our futures; if physics doesn’t optimize how our world is engineered today, our children will pay the mortal toll tomorrow.</p>
<p>While physics provides understanding of the world, engineering uses that understanding to drive change. And I want to be a part of that change.</p>
<p>To make my contribution, I will be writing about <strong>trains</strong>! I personally believe that trains will have a large role in the redesign of our world. Locomotion produces 80% less greenhouse gases than cars, goes super fast, carries many passangers, and can be hidden underground to free space on Earth's surface. The story of trains is surprisingly exciting and so is the physics involved. Tomorrow, is the first day of the train series. Full steam ahead!</p>
