### Have you tried skipping?

If you like oscillation patterns and moving around, you'll love skipping. The joy of skipping home is unlike no other.
When you firsted walked homed, the novelty of the activity was a thrill. Now, imagine reigniting that sensation of a new experience all over again with <i>skipping</i> home!

Now, I know what you're thinking: "I don't want to look like a weirdo!"

However, this is simply a uninformed opinion. People who WALK are weirdos. Walking around is only "normal" because we have been doing it for ages.
It is only a matter of time until skipping from work to home is the new standard. I encourage people to not only skip everywhere, but to raise their children as skippers as well. Here is a picture of a lion to inspire your skipping revolution, don't let him down:

#lion {

  margin-left:auto;
  margin-right:auto;
}
</style>
