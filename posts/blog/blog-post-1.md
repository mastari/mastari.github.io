If you like oscillation patterns and moving around, you'll love skipping. The joy of skipping home is unlike no other.
When you firsted walked homed, the novelty of the activity was a thrill. Now, imagine reigniting that sensation of a new experience all over again with <i>skipping</i> home!

Now, I know what you're thinking: "I don't want to look like a weirdo!"
However, this is simply a uninformed opinion. People who WALK are weirdos. Walking around is only "normal" because we have been doing it for ages.
It is only a matter of time until skipping from work to home is the new standard. I encourage people to not only skip everywhere, but to raise their children as skippers as well.
