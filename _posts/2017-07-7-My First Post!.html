Welcome to the Mastari Blog! I am a student, film enthusiast, and I love pretty much anything related to technology and science. On this blog I will be
writing about short films I am working on, coding projects, and random things totally unrelated. I have a youtube channel I am starting up as of now and
I will be posting short films I make with friends. I upload usually in the while making videos, giving updates with the visual effects and process.
